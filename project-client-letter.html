<p>FIRST:</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>Legally speaking, once you sign it back to me, this letter will be a binding agreement, or contract, for my legal services.  That agreement will rest on the foundation of the special rules that govern my work as a lawyer.  To be clear, I am not CLIENT’s lawyer until we have all signed this letter.</p>
<p>It is almost always best to get the details of this kind of relationship down in words that everyone understands.  To that end, I’ve done my best to write this letter clearly, without legalese.  If any part of this letter is unclear to you, let me know.  We should make it clear.  Of course, if any questions come up later, please let me know as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Our terms are as follows:</p>
<p>I commit to represent and assist CLIENT, INC., the business, as legal counsel.  I do not commit to represent any officer, member, employee, contractor, or other individual related to the company.  In other words, this letter will make me CLIENT’s lawyer, but not your personal lawyer or anyone else’s personal lawyer.  If there is ever any conflict between CLIENT and a person involved with CLIENT, I will represent, and be professionally responsible to, CLIENT.</p>
<p>I commit to represent and assist CLIENT in PROJECT DESCRIPTION.  When that project ends, either when SUCCESS DESCRIPTION, or it becomes clear that the project will not go through, our attorney-client relationship will end, too.  Feel free to contact me if you have other legal needs.  But I am not committing to represent you in any other matters now.</p>
<p>From time to time I may want to use outside help to do legal work more efficiently or effectively.  I may use other lawyers and non-lawyer staff to help me.</p>
<p>Regardless, the legal services and advice I provide will be only as useful as the information provided to me is complete, accurate, and up-to-date.  CLIENT will do its part to provide me good information when I need it.</p>
<p>In exchange for my services, CLIENT will pay my fees and approved expenses.</p>
<p>I will bill for my services on a time basis.  My rate will initially be $X per hour, billed in fairly rounded quarter-hours spent actively advancing CLIENT’s legal interests.  My rate may increase at the beginning of any future calendar year, but never without advance written notice.</p>
<p>Now and again, I may estimate my fee for a specific legal project via e-mail.  CLIENT will promptly reply to approve or reject my estimates.  In case of unforeseen complications or extraordinary circumstances, I will notify CLIENT that my fee for a project may exceed my estimate, and we will agree by e-mail how to calculate any additional amount.  Otherwise, my fee for any project for which CLIENT approved an estimate will be the estimate CLIENT approved.</p>
<p>I may incur expenses, like filing fees, postage, and costs of extraordinary travel, for CLIENT’s benefit.  I will notify CLIENT when I expect to incur an expense, and CLIENT will reimburse me for expenses that it approves ahead of time.  I may require CLIENT to advance estimated expenses, and I won’t have to pay any expenses for CLIENT that CLIENT doesn’t agree to pay or advance.</p>
<p>I will bill CLIENT for fees and expenses at the end of each calendar month.  CLIENT will pay all bills by bank transfer, according to payment instructions I provide, within thirty calendar days of receipt.  CLIENT will increase the amount of any bill payment to me to offset costs and fees or bank transfer or CLIENT billing or payment systems.</p>
<p>Lawyers are subject to rules, called conflict of interest rules, that prevent them from representing clients with certain kinds of competing interests, especially when they may have received confidential information from one client that’s useful to another.  I have checked my records and concluded that representing CLIENT won’t cause any conflict-of-interest problem under the rules governing California attorneys like me.  That being said, if I discover a conflict in the future, CLIENT will assist, within reason, to help me resolve the conflict to the satisfaction of all involved.  As a general matter, CLIENT will not prevent me from representing other clients that may compete with CLIENT or perform similar activities to CLIENT’s.</p>
<p>Pursuant to California Rule of Professional Conduct 3-410, I am informing you in writing that I do not have professional liability insurance.  If you have any questions about what that means, or how it might affect CLIENT, please let me know before signing this letter.  Going forward, always feel free to contact me directly about matters concerning the professional, financial, or other aspects of our relationship.  It is part of my job to help you understand mine, and how to use legal services efficiently and effectively.</p>
<p>CLIENT can end our attorney-client relationship at any time, and I reserve the right to stop work on any legal matter at any time. I can withdraw from our attorney-client relationship when doing so won’t have a significant negative effect on CLIENT, or when necessary to avoid ethical issues.  Otherwise, I’ll need CLIENT’s consent to withdraw.</p>
<p>If we decide to change these terms in the future, we will write out the changes and sign them.  No other changes will count.</p>
<p>Please feel free to phone me at 510-712-0933 or e-mail me at kyle@kemitchell.com if you have any questions.  Again, thanks so much for the opportunity to assist.</p>
