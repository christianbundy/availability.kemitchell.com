      <h1>Kyle E. Mitchell’s Availability</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p>This page describes the kinds of working relationships I seek and my availability for new ones.</p>
      <p>
        Generally speaking, I serve four kinds of clients as legal counsel:
        <a href=#regular>regular clients</a>,
        <a href=#project>project clients</a>,
        <a href=#standby>standby clients</a>, and
        <a href=#probono>pro bono clients</a>.
        I also support some <a href=#colleagues>lawyer colleagues</a> who need help with specific questions from time to time, as I’m supported by others.
      </p>

      <h2 id=regular>Regular Clients</h2>
      <p class=success>I could take one more regular client, depending on their needs.  <a href=mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com>E-mail me anytime.</a></p>
      <p>Regular clients require substantial time each workweek, and sometimes each workday, many workdays in a row.  Their needs can vary widely, month to month.  Typically, regular clients see me as “inside-out counsel”, or outside counsel working as general counsel.</p>
      <p>Regular clients pay a flat monthly fee for my services.  The flat fee can be renegotiated anytime, but fee changes apply only to future months, never retroactively.</p>

      <h2 id=project>Project Clients</h2>
      <p class=success>I am available to take new project clients.  <a href=mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com>E-mail me anytime.</a></p>
      <p>Project clients hire me to help with specific legal projects or deals.  When a project ends, the working relationship ends with it.  In legal jargon, project clients have “limited-scope engagements”.</p>
      <p>I’m always happy to hear from former project clients about new opportunities.  But I don’t commit to stay available to project clients after the current project.</p>
      <p>Some project clients pay an hourly rate and expenses.  Some project clients play flat rates, for the whole project, per week, or otherwise.  Depends on the project.</p>

      <h2 id=standby>Standby Clients</h2>
      <p class=danger>I’m not currently taking new standby clients.</p>
      <p>Standby clients require my help unpredictably.  Sometimes deals for standby clients require work for several weeks in a row.  Sometimes standby clients go months without messaging me at all.  Standby clients often see me as “inside-out counsel”—outside counsel working as general counsel—but their needs are minimal.</p>
      <p>Standby clients pay an hourly rate plus expenses.</p>

      <h2 id=probono>Pro Bono Clients</h2>
      <p class=danger>I’m not currently taking new pro bono clients.</p>
      <p>Pro bono clients do not pay.</p>
      <p>Pro bono clients’ needs vary.  However, I usually seek pro bono clients with needs more like <a href=#regular>regular clients</a> than <a href=#project>project clients</a>.</p>

      <h2 id=colleagues>Colleagues</h2>
      <p class=success>I’m always happy to meet and support fellow lawyers.  <a href=mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com>Send me an e-mail anytime.</a></p>
      <p>Fellow lawyers aren’t law clients, but lawyers themselves.  However, colleagues occasionally need help with specific questions, often out of client work, that point to my legal and technical background.</p>
      <p>When colleagues expect to send me questions for specific clients of theirs here and there, they often ask to pay an hourly rate.</p>
      <p>I am always happy to discuss interesting new developments, problems, and hypotheticals with other attorneys who have as much to teach me as I have to teach them.  Sometimes I feel I should pay <em>them</em>.  I’m happy to do so!</p>
