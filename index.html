      <h1>Kyle E. Mitchell’s Professional Availability</h1>
    </header>

    <main>
      <p>This page describes the kinds of working relationships I seek, as well as my availability for new ones.</p>
      <p>
        Generally speaking, I serve four kinds of clients as legal counsel:
        <a href=#regular>regular clients</a>,
        <a href=#project>project clients</a>,
        <a href=#standby>standby clients</a>, and
        <a href=#probono>pro bono clients</a>.
        I also support some <a href=#colleagues>lawyer colleagues</a> who need help with specific questions from time to time.
      </p>

      <h2 id=regular>Regular Clients</h2>
      <p class=available>I could take one more regular client, depending on their time needs.  <a href=mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com>E-mail me anytime.</a></p>
      <p>Regular clients require substantial time each workweek, and often each workday.  Their needs can vary widely, month to month.  Typically, regular clients see me as “inside-out counsel”—outside counsel working as general counsel.</p>
      <p>Regular clients pay a flat monthly fee for my services.  The flat fee can be renegotiated at any time, but fee changes apply only to future months, never retroactively.</p>

      <h2 id=project>Project Clients</h2>
      <p class=available>I am available to take new project clients.  <a href=mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com>E-mail me anytime.</a></p>
      <p>Project clients hire me to help with specific legal projects or deals.  When a project ends, the working relationship ends with it.  In legal jargon, project clients have “limited-scope engagements”.</p>
      <p>I’m always happy to hear from former project clients about new projects.  But I don’t make any availability commitment to project clients after the current project.</p>
      <p>Some project clients pay an hourly rate, plus any expenses.  Some project clients play flat rates, for the whole project, per week, or otherwise.</p>

      <h2 id=standby>Standby Clients</h2>
      <p class=unavailable>I’m not currently taking new standby clients.</p>
      <p>Standby clients require time irregularly.  Sometimes deals for standby clients require attention for several weeks in a row.  Sometimes standby clients go months without requiring any time.  Standby clients often see me as “inside-out counsel”—outside counsel working as general counsel—but their needs are minimal.</p>
      <p>Standby clients pay an hourly rate, plus any expenses.</p>

      <h2 id=probono>Pro Bono Clients</h2>
      <p class=unavailable>I’m not currently taking new pro bono clients.</p>
      <p>Pro bono clients do not pay.</p>
      <p>Pro bono clients’ needs vary.  However, I usually seek pro bono clients with needs more like <a href=#regular>regular clients</a> than <a href=#project>project clients</a>.</p>

      <h2 id=colleagues>Colleagues</h2>
      <p class=available>I am almost always available to meet and support fellow attorneys.  <a href=mailto:kyle@kemitchell.com>Send me an e-mail.</a></p>
      <p>Fellow lawyers aren’t law clients, but lawyers themselves.  However, clleagues occasionally need help with specific questions, often from specific needs of their clients, that draw on my legal and technical knowledge.</p>
      <p>When colleagues expect to send me questions for specific clients of theirs here and there, they often ask to pay an hourly rate.</p>
      <p>I am always happy to discuss interesting new developments, problems, and hypotheticals with other attorneys who have as much or more to teach me, as I have to teach them.  Sometimes I feel like I should pay <em>them</em>.  I’m happy to do so!</p>
